    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Native African dish made from a variety of ingredients. It is eaten with a variety of soups and meats.Fufu is a starchy dough that takes on different forms (and names) across many West African countries. However the name ‘Fufu’ is most commonly associated with Ghana, specifically with the Akan ethnic group. Ghanaian Fufu is commonly made by “pounding” cassava and unripe plantains together into a paste, which is then molded by hand into a ball shape and served with a special sauce/soup. In essence it is the sauce/soup that really gives each Fufu dish its unique identity. In Ghana, the common Fufu dishes are Fufu with Light Soup, Fufu with Palm Nut Soup and Fufu with Groundnut Soup.</p>

    <p>Like most African and Middle Eastern dishes, Fufu is typically eaten by hand, and is served with a tasty sauce/soup. This fact might intimidate you if you if you grew up in a Eurocentric environment that tends to place stock on using cutlery/silverware to eat. If you have no experience with finger foods, I recommend you “warm” yourself up by first being open minded and perhaps starting slow with Ethiopian finger food, and then work your way up to Fufu, which is a more complex eating experience. Fufu is a very heavy meal, so in Ghana this dish is typically eaten on Sunday afternoons, when most people come in from prayers at their respective temples, and there is nothing left in the day to do. The idea is you prep yourself, enjoy the meal preferably with a chilled Guinness, Heineken or water, and then go into a state of ‘Fufu paralysis,’ which usually involves a long nap as the Fufu maps its way through your digestive system.</p>
